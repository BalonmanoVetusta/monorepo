  - [ ] Scan ticket process
  - [ ] View current number of people in the court
  - [ ] Private events based on the people inside the event (jackpots).
- [ ] Automate the task to twit results and matches of the week with Github Actions.
  - [ ] Read the rfebm page.
  - [ ] Schedule a task to deploy with the new information.
  - [ ] Post that information to Twitter (inside the Github actior or by webhook).
- [ ] Github action that should be executed manually to generate updated results and twit results of the week.
- [ ] Check if twits can be program throught the API and do program twits for the next week. Have in consideration when the season has finished or stop by some weeks. **This should be done with previous Github Action as well.**
- [ ] Automate Twits while in match? For this I need to check if I can automate Github actions based on other Github actions just to fetch the data from rfebm and twit in seconds every 5 minutes until the match has ended.
